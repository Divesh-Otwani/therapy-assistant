## Coding Style Rules

1. Functions should be no longer than 40 lines of code; ideally under 25.

2. Comments should be at the top of functions and classes and 
rarely in the middle of lines of code:


```java

/* Good descriptive comment */
int function(){
  x.do_something(); // this short comment is fine
  // avoid this line comment!!!
  y.dothis();
  return 0;
  }

```
