# Coding Style Rules

1. Functions should be no longer than 40 lines of code

2. Comments at the top of functions and classes, rarely in the middle of lines
   of code. 

   This is ok though:

```java


int function(){
  x.do_something(); // this short comment is fine
  // avoid this line comment!!!
  y.dothis();
  return 0;
  }

```
