# therapy-assistant
This is an app to assist with certain therapies, starting with cognitive behavioral therapy.


# Coding Style Rules

1. Functions should be no longer than 40 lines of code

2. Comments at the top of functions and classes, rarely in the middle of lines
   of code. 

   This is ok though:

```java


int function(){
  x.do_something(); // this short comment is fine
  // avoid this line comment!!!
  y.dothis();
  return 0;
  }

```

# Things to do in next week


 * Divesh: Have 5 basic activities for exercises + home ready -- even if they
   just display text (but in the right spots with good extensible changeable
   layouts)
 * Brian: Pair program with Zach on (1) the several resources classes and (2)
   making 3 resource activities; really basic (display text but in the right
   places)
 * Yasmine: Implement pulling of resources.


# Things To Discuss

 * Adding articles and stuff via an app for the therapist (or maybe just an
   online interface?)

 * Make things pretty
   * Add images
   * Add a nice theme
