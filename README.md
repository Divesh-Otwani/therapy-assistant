# therapy-assistant

This is an app to assist with certain therapies by logging client exercises and
providing resources. The only therapy currently supported is CBT, cognitive
behavioral therapy.

## What's Different

Most therapy applications try to replace or facilitate therapy. Self-help applications, while helpful for some individuals, are not so helpful for individuals with problems that are moderate or more than moderate. Other applications connect individuals to licenced clinicians via texts or message boards -- the goal of this application is different.

We hope to (eventually) create a robust application that **supplements**
therapy by, first, making the "homework" a patient usually does (exercises on
paper, journal entries, breathing exercises, etc.) doable through a mobile
application. Second, this app should also provide official resources about
treatment and psychopathology. All of this should be customizable by the
therapist but backed by a default and standard database of exercises and
resources.

## Current Features

Our main feature is the ability to take and log cognitive behavioral exercises
that can later be shown in therapy. This replaces the current system in which
patients write down their work on paper.

Effectively, a user can select from a number of standard exercises that help the patient and the licenced clinicians analyze and treat problems. After sliding through all the questions in the exercise, the patient can view his or her completed exercises and show them to his or her therapist.


## Future Work \& Goals

 * Security: make the app HIPA compliant.
 * Make the app use accounts. Using email accounts, pair clients to therapists.
   This will require a log-in page and a page for patients and a page for
   therapists.
 * Make a website through which therapists can change their patients'
   exercises.
 * Make the exercises broader and like "20 questions" in that they can cover a
   general topic and progress through questions in response to previous ones.
   For example, after selecting a few thinking errors in an exercise for
   anxiety, we should ask questions tailored to those thinking errors.


## Team \& Contact

If this application and it's niche (assisting rather than replacing or facilitating therapy) seems appealing to you, contact Divesh Otwani (the owner of this repository).

We worked on this in our mobile development class -- Haverford, Fall 2018 with Professor Kris Micinski.
